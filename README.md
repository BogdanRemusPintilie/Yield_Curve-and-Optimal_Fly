This is how I would go through it:

1. **REPORT** contains an actual **Report.docx** (explains what I did conceptually but doesn't tackle the code)
2. In **Code** in **PCA**, you will find the main notebook where there is everything apart from how I got to the predicted values of the PCs
3. In **Code** in **Lasso regression**, you will find the formulas for the PCs
4. In **Data** in **Expected values of predictor variables (6 mo horizon - 31-12-2024)** in **Work**, you will find the code used for predicting values of the predictor variables of the Lasso Regression

I think that's pretty much it, with the rest being steps taken to perform the above.

I had to write to a relatively knowledgeable audience (~ undergrads), so I explained briefly how the techniques that I used work (e.g., PCA).
