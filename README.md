1. REPORT contains an actual Report.docx (writing that explains what I did but doesn't tackle the code at all).
2. In Code in PCA you will find the main notebook where there is everything apart from how I got to the predicted values of the PCs
3. In Data in Expected values of predictor... in Work you will find the code used for predicting values of the exogenous variables (predictor variables of the Lasso Regression)
4. In Code in Lasso regression you will find the formulas for the PCs

I think that is pretty much it, with the rest being steps took to get to perform the above.

I had to write to a relatively knowledgeable audience (~ undergrads), reason why I kinda explained how the techniques used work (i.e., PCA).
