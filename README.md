This is how I would go through it:

1. REPORT contains an actual Report.docx (explains what I did but doesn't tackle the code)
2. In Code in PCA, you will find the main notebook where there is everything apart from how I got to the predicted values of the PCs
3. In Data in Expected values of predictor variables (6 mo horizon - 31-12-2024) in Work, you will find the code used for predicting values of the exogenous variables (predictor variables of the Lasso Regression)
4. In Code in Lasso regression, you will find the formulas for the PCs

I think that's pretty much it, with the rest being the steps taken to perform the above.

I had to write to a relatively knowledgeable audience (~ undergrads), so I kind of explained how the techniques used work (e.g., PCA).
