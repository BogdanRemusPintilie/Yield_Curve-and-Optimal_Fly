This is how I would approach Yield Curve & Optimal Fly:

The **REPORT** folder contains an actual **Report.docx**, which explains what I did conceptually but does not cover the code. I had to write for a relatively knowledgeable audience (roughly undergraduate level), so I briefly explained how PCA works.

In **Code** under the **PCA** section, you will find the main notebook, which contains everything except how I arrived at the predicted values of the PCs.

In **Code** under the **Lasso regression** section, you will find the formulas for the PCs.

In **Data**, under **Expected values of predictor variables (6-month horizon - 31-12-2024)**, located in **Work**, you will find the code used to predict the values of the predictor variables for the Lasso Regression.

I think that covers everything, with the rest being the steps taken to perform the above.
